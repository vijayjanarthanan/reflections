When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all the changes to your local?
I would do it when I want to collaborate with the other team members and make my changes available to the others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I can resolve any conflicts when I pull manually whereas if it is automatic I will not be able to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
When you want to clone on the Git Hub you use Fork which creates a copy of a remote and also maintains count of how many the remote has been forked. Clones can be used when you want to clone a branch in local you want to clone a branch from the remote (Git Hub). Branches are for creating a copy of another branch in local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So we are up to date on the remote copy and we can compare our changes to the latest changes on remote even if we are offline.
