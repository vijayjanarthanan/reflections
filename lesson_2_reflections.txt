What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It initializes and prepares the folder to be comitted to the git repository. It adds the required metadata to track the files the folders in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a place where you can move your files that you want to commit. It gives us the value of providing a space to park the files that are supposed to comitted.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use the git add to add each logical change to the Staging area and committing it and then going back to the next logical change and follow the same process

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When we want to try something new, we can create a branch from the master and continue to work on the new implementation and later merge it back into the master. This way the others can continue to work on the master and make changes.
